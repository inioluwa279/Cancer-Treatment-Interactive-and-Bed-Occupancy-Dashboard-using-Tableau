The pathway to cancer diagnosis and staging, leading to a decision-to-treat date, can be complex for cancer patients because it involves several medical investigations and decision-making processes. The Scottish Government, through NHS Scotland, currently has two Cancer Waiting Times (CWT) standards – The 31-day and 62-day standard targets.  

To ensure ‘First Treatment’ occurs within the CWT across all NHS boards, there is currently a 5% tolerance for CWT in Scotland. This report investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on NHS bed availability and the number of eligible cancer referrals treated within the 62-day standard wait time. The Time series analysis revealed that only two NHS boards (NHS Borders and NHS Shetlands) met the 62-day standard, while the percentage of cancer referrals treated by other HBs fell to an average of 83% during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.  

#Data preparation and cleansing 
Two main data sets were provided for this analysis, in addition to other metadata sets. The data preparation and cleaning was done to ensure the data was properly formatted before analysis and visualisation were done. Both datasets were cleaned using Microsoft Excel and Tableau Prep. 

#Four Key Questions 
The four key questions for NHS Scotland to consider when measuring the success of its forecasting techniques are; 
1. Have we built a momentum case? 
2. Are we using a variety of operational indicators and external inputs? 
3. Have we explored automation? 
4. Are we measuring effectiveness at a fine grained level?   

Issues with Forecasting Application 
Some of the possible challenges that NHS Scotland may encounter in the application of the forecasting approach include. 
1. Unforeseen events like Seasonal periods or a pandemic 
2. Adequate Staffing required 
3. Deployment of limited resources 
4. Cost control challenges
